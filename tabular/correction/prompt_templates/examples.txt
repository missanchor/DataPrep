In the pattern identified earlier, street types are typically abbreviated as 'ST', 'AVE', 'BLVD', etc. 'SX' does not match any common street type abbreviations, suggesting that it is an error. 3.Data Transformation: Based on the pattern identified and the error analysis, the correct form of the address should be '1025 W ADDISON ST'.

This null value is likely due to missing or incomplete data entry. 3.Data Transformation: Based on the pattern identified in step 1, we can confidently transform the 'NULL' value in the Dirty Data Tuple to 'Grocery Store'.
